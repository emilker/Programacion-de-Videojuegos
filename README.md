Power-Up added to Breakout gameplay

Implemented the functionality of the ball-freezing power-up. When activated, this power-up causes all balls in the game to temporarily stop, giving the player a brief advantage to rearrange their strategy or destroy bricks in a more advantageous position.

The power-up activation is created when the red dot block is hit by the player's paddle.

The effect it has is to freeze all the balls that are in the game for a certain time (exactly for 2.5 seconds). At the end of this time, the balls return to their initial movement.
